Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI where systems learn from data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Python provides extensive libraries to build ML models efficiently. This lesson covers fundamental concepts, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and model evaluation. Supervised learning involves training a model with labeled data to predict outcomes, while unsupervised learning identifies patterns in unlabeled datasets. You will use scikit-learn to implement algorithms like regression, classification, and clustering. Key concepts like train-test split, feature scaling, and accuracy metrics are covered to evaluate model performance. By working on hands-on projects, you will understand the practical workflow of ML in Python, preparing you for advanced AI applications like neural networks and deep learning.
