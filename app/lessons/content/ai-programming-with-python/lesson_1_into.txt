Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries by enabling machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Python is one of the most popular languages for AI due to its simplicity and rich libraries for machine learning and neural networks. This course introduces AI concepts such as supervised and unsupervised learning, model training, and evaluation. You will learn to use Python libraries like scikit-learn for traditional machine learning, NumPy for numerical computations, and Pandas for data handling. Understanding AI begins with basic algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, and k-nearest neighbors. Pythonâ€™s intuitive syntax allows beginners to focus on learning AI concepts rather than complex programming. By the end of this lesson, you will be able to set up a Python environment for AI projects and understand the workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
