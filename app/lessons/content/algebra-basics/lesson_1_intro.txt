Algebra is a branch of mathematics dealing with symbols, variables, and equations. It allows us to generalize arithmetic operations and solve problems systematically. Beginners start with expressions, linear equations, and basic operations on variables. Understanding concepts like constants, coefficients, and terms is essential. This lesson focuses on simplifying expressions, solving one-step and two-step equations, and understanding the fundamental principles of algebra. Algebra forms the foundation for advanced mathematics, including calculus, trigonometry, and geometry.
