Linear equations have variables with a power of one and represent straight lines on a graph. Quadratic equations have variables squared and form parabolas. Solving equations involves factoring, using the quadratic formula, and completing the square. Word problems translate real-world scenarios into algebraic expressions. This lesson covers techniques for solving both linear and quadratic equations, emphasizing logical reasoning and step-by-step problem-solving. Mastery of these concepts is essential for higher-level mathematics and applications in science, engineering, and technology.
