Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that has become one of the most widely used languages in software development. Originally developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995, Java was designed to be platform-independent, meaning a program written once can run anywhere with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This principle, “write once, run anywhere,” made Java highly popular for enterprise applications, web services, and mobile development through Android. Java combines the best of C++ syntax with simplified memory management, reducing complexity for developers. It supports object-oriented principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which help in building reusable and maintainable code. Additionally, Java has a rich standard library with APIs for networking, file handling, database connectivity, and user interface development. Its strong security model and automatic garbage collection are also notable features. In this course, you will start by understanding Java syntax, variables, and control flow, gradually moving to object-oriented concepts, exceptions, collections, and eventually building real-world projects.
