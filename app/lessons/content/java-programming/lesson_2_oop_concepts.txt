Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a paradigm that organizes software design around objects rather than functions. In Java, OOP is central to building scalable applications. The four main pillars of OOP are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. Encapsulation involves bundling data (fields) and methods into a single unit or class and controlling access with modifiers like private and public. Abstraction allows developers to hide complex implementation details and expose only relevant features through abstract classes or interfaces. Inheritance lets one class derive properties and behaviors from another, promoting code reuse. Polymorphism enables a single method or object to take multiple forms, enhancing flexibility in code. Java implements these concepts elegantly, with classes, interfaces, and packages. Understanding OOP in Java lays the foundation for advanced topics like design patterns, multithreading, and enterprise frameworks. Through hands-on examples, youâ€™ll learn to create classes, implement interfaces, and structure projects in a modular way.
