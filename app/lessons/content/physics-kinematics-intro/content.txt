Physics Kinematics — Core Concepts & Examples

1D Motion:
- Equations of motion for uniformly accelerated motion (UAM):
  1. v = u + at
  2. s = ut + 1/2 at^2
  3. v^2 = u^2 + 2as
  (Where u = initial velocity, v = final velocity, a = acceleration, s = displacement, t = time)

- Free fall and vertical motion:
  - g = 9.8 m/s^2 (downward)
  - Upwards motion: v = u - gt, s = ut - 1/2 gt^2
  - Maximum height H = u^2 / (2g), Time to reach max height t = u/g

2D Motion:
- Projectile motion:
  - Horizontal motion: x = u_x * t
  - Vertical motion: y = u_y * t - 1/2 g t^2
  - Range R = (u^2 sin 2θ) / g, Maximum height H = (u^2 sin^2 θ) / (2g)
  - Trajectory equation: y = x tanθ - (g x^2) / (2 u^2 cos^2 θ)

- Relative motion:
  - Velocity relative to moving frames
  - Addition of velocities in vector form

Graphical Analysis:
- Velocity-time graph: slope = acceleration, area = displacement
- Displacement-time graph: slope = velocity
- Acceleration-time graph: area = change in velocity

Key JEE Tips:
- Always identify the frame of reference.
- Break vectors into components along axes.
- Use equations of motion smartly; avoid repetitive calculations.
- Draw diagrams for motion — visual clarity saves time.
