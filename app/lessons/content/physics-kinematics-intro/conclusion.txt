Physics Kinematics — Summary & Applications

Summary:
- Kinematics deals with describing motion using displacement, velocity, and acceleration.
- Key equations: v = u + at, s = ut + 1/2 at^2, v^2 = u^2 + 2as.
- Motion types: linear (1D), projectile (2D), free fall, relative motion.
- Graphs help visualize motion and understand relationships.

Applications in JEE:
- Solving numericals with UAM and free-fall.
- Projectile motion problems — horizontal range, maximum height.
- Relative velocity problems — trains, boats, wind velocity.
- Optimization questions — maximum height, minimum time, range.

Next Steps:
- Practice numerical problems topic-wise.
- Always verify units and directions.
- Gradually increase complexity (multi-step problems).
- Combine graphical, algebraic, and vector approaches for speed and accuracy.
