Lesson Content:
Reading comprehension is the ability to read, interpret, and understand written texts effectively. It involves extracting meaning, identifying key ideas, analyzing arguments, drawing inferences, and evaluating content critically. Strong comprehension skills allow readers to engage with texts across genres, including narratives, essays, scientific articles, technical documents, and literary works. Techniques such as skimming, scanning, summarizing, and annotating enhance understanding and retention, while recognizing context, tone, and author intent enables deeper insights. Vocabulary knowledge, sentence structure awareness, and prior knowledge of the subject matter contribute to accurate comprehension. In academic and professional contexts, reading comprehension is essential for problem-solving, decision-making, and research. In examinations, it tests analytical, interpretive, and evaluative abilities. Beyond academics, reading comprehension empowers individuals to navigate information-rich environments, critically assess content, and communicate effectively. Developing this skill fosters intellectual curiosity, lifelong learning, and the capacity to engage with complex ideas, making it a cornerstone of literacy and cognitive development.
