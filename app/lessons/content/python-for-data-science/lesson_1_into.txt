Python has become the go-to language for data science due to its simplicity, readability, and extensive ecosystem of libraries. Data science involves extracting meaningful insights from raw data, and Python provides the tools needed for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Beginners often start with Python’s basic syntax, data types, loops, and functions, which provide a foundation for handling datasets. Libraries like Pandas allow efficient manipulation of structured data in tables, while NumPy offers powerful tools for numerical computations. Python’s flexibility allows integration with databases, APIs, and other data sources. Its readable syntax makes it easier for analysts, statisticians, and developers to collaborate on projects. In this course, you will explore Python fundamentals, setting up your environment, and handling datasets to perform real-world analyses.
