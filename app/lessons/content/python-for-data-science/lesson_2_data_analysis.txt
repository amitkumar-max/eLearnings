Data analysis in Python involves cleaning, transforming, and exploring datasets to extract meaningful insights. Pandas is a key library used for handling tabular data efficiently. It provides DataFrames, which are like spreadsheets in code, allowing filtering, aggregation, and merging of data. Visualization is another crucial step; libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn help create plots that make patterns and trends visible. Python also enables statistical analysis, such as correlation, regression, and hypothesis testing, using libraries like SciPy and StatsModels. In this lesson, you will learn to load CSV and Excel files, handle missing values, perform data aggregation, and generate meaningful visualizations. By the end, you will be able to analyze datasets and communicate insights effectively, a vital skill in data-driven industries.
