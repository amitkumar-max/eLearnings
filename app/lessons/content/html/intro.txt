HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of the web. It defines the structure and layout of web pages, using a system of elements and tags. Every web page you see in a browser is built with HTML at its core. The language allows you to organize content like headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and tables in a structured way. Think of HTML as the skeleton of a webpage; without it, there is nothing for a browser to display. 

HTML is made up of elements, each represented by tags. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets like <tagname> and typically have an opening and closing pair, such as <p>â€¦</p> for a paragraph. Attributes within tags provide additional information, such as `href` in anchor tags for linking pages. Understanding the purpose of each element and using them correctly is essential for building accessible, well-structured, and responsive web pages.

In this course, you will start by learning the basic HTML tags, their usage, and how to structure a simple web page. By the end of this section, you will be able to create web pages containing headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links, and tables with proper syntax and semantics.
