Sentence structure is a core aspect of grammar that determines clarity and coherence. Simple, compound, and complex sentences allow varying levels of detail and expression. Punctuation marks, such as commas, periods, semicolons, and apostrophes, help convey meaning and prevent ambiguity. This lesson explains sentence components like subjects, predicates, objects, and modifiers. By practicing sentence construction and identifying errors, learners improve their writing style, readability, and comprehension skills. Strong grammar skills are essential for academic success, professional communication, and creative writing.
