Geometry is a branch of mathematics concerned with the properties, measurement, and relationships of points, lines, angles, surfaces, and solids. It is foundational in understanding shapes, spatial reasoning, and problem-solving. Beginners start by learning basic concepts such as points, lines, angles, triangles, quadrilaterals, and circles. Key principles include congruence, similarity, the Pythagorean theorem, and properties of polygons. This lesson provides a structured approach to understanding shapes, their relationships, and fundamental theorems that form the basis for advanced geometry.
