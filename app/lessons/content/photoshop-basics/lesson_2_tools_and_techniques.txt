Photoshopâ€™s key strength is its wide range of tools and techniques. Selection tools allow you to isolate parts of an image for editing. The brush tool enables painting and retouching, while the clone stamp helps remove unwanted objects. Layer masks give non-destructive editing capabilities, allowing changes without permanently altering the original image. Adjustment layers allow color correction, contrast enhancement, and artistic effects. Understanding blending modes, filters, and text tools adds depth to your designs. By practicing these techniques, beginners can create visually appealing compositions, retouch images professionally, and gain confidence in using Photoshop for creative projects.
