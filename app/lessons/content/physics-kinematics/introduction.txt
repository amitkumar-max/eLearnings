Physics Kinematics â€” Introduction

Kinematics is the branch of mechanics that describes the motion of objects without considering the forces causing the motion. It focuses on parameters like displacement, velocity, and acceleration.

Key Concepts:
1. Scalars vs Vectors:
   - Scalars: magnitude only (e.g., speed, distance, time)
   - Vectors: magnitude + direction (e.g., displacement, velocity, acceleration)

2. Position and Displacement:
   - Position: location of a particle relative to origin.
   - Displacement: change in position (vector quantity).

3. Speed and Velocity:
   - Speed = distance / time (scalar)
   - Velocity = displacement / time (vector)

4. Acceleration:
   - Rate of change of velocity with respect to time.
   - Uniform and non-uniform acceleration.

This course will cover motion in 1D and 2D, equations of motion, graphical analysis, and application of kinematic principles in solving JEE problems.
