Lesson Content:
Biomolecules are organic and inorganic compounds essential for life, forming the structural components and functional machinery of living organisms. These molecules include carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, vitamins, and hormones, each playing unique roles in maintaining life processes. Carbohydrates serve as the primary energy source and structural components in cells, with monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides forming a diverse range of molecules. Proteins, composed of amino acids, are involved in catalysis, structural support, transport, signaling, and defense. Enzymes, a special class of proteins, accelerate biochemical reactions and regulate metabolic pathways. Lipids, including fats, oils, phospholipids, and steroids, provide long-term energy storage, form cellular membranes, and act as signaling molecules. Nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, store and transmit genetic information, directing protein synthesis and controlling cellular functions. Vitamins and hormones act as coenzymes, regulators, and signaling molecules, influencing growth, development, and homeostasis. Studying biomolecules combines chemistry and biology, highlighting the intricate chemical interactions that sustain life. Knowledge of biomolecules is fundamental for biochemistry, molecular biology, medicine, nutrition, pharmacology, and biotechnology, providing insight into metabolic disorders, disease mechanisms, and therapeutic interventions. Understanding their chemical structure and functions enables scientists to manipulate biological systems for medical and industrial applications, bridging the gap between molecular chemistry and living systems.
