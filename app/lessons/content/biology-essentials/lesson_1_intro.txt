Biology is the scientific study of life and living organisms. It encompasses a wide range of topics from cellular structures to complex ecosystems. Understanding biology begins with cells, the basic unit of life, their structure, functions, and organelles. DNA and RNA play key roles in heredity, replication, and protein synthesis. This lesson introduces the fundamentals of biology, including cell theory, classification of organisms, and basic biochemistry. Knowledge of these core concepts lays the groundwork for advanced topics like genetics, physiology, and ecology.
