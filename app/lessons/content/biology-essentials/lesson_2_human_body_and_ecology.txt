The human body is a complex system composed of organs and organ systems that maintain life. Biology explores anatomy, physiology, and the functions of different systems, including the circulatory, respiratory, nervous, and digestive systems. Beyond humans, biology studies interactions within ecosystems, the roles of producers, consumers, and decomposers, and the impact of human activities on biodiversity. Understanding ecological principles helps in conservation and sustainability efforts. This lesson emphasizes the interconnectedness of life, the importance of maintaining ecological balance, and the biological processes that sustain living organisms.
