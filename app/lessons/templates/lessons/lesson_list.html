             int i;
             byte y; 
             i = x << 2;
             y = (byte) (x << 2);
             System.out.print(i + " " + y);
        } 
    }
a) 0 256
b) 0 64
c) 256 0
d) 64 0
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: A variable of type int can store values within 32 bits, while a byte has only 8 bits to store any value. The expression (64 << 2) results in 256, which requires at least 9 bits to represent. Therefore:
For byte: The 9th bit is lost (truncated), and the remaining 8 bits are all zeros, resulting in zero.
For int: All significant bits are preserved, allowing the value 256 to be stored correctly.
output:

$ javac leftshift_operator.java
$ java leftshift_operator
256 0
16. What will be the output of the following Java code?

             int y = obj.width * obj.height * obj.length; 
             System.out.print(y);
        } 
    }
a) 100
b) 400
c) 200
d) 12
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: The variables length, breadth, and height are default (friendly) instance variables of the Box class. Therefore, they can be accessed directly by the object. The variable y stores the product of these three variables, resulting in an output of 200.
output:
$ javac main.java
$ java main
200

       {
	    t1 = new Thread(this,"Thread_1");
	    t2 = new Thread(this,"Thread_2");
	    t1.start();
	    t2.start();
	}
	public void run()
       {
	    t2.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);	
	    System.out.print(t1.equals(t2));
       }   
   }
   class multithreaded_programing
   {
       public static void main(String args[])
       {
           new newthread();       
       }
   }
a) truetrue
b) falsefalse
c) true
d) false
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: Threads t1 and t2 are created by the NewThread class, which implements the Runnable interface. Therefore, both threads have their own run() methods defining the actions to be performed. When the constructor of the NewThread class is invoked, the run() method of t1 executes first, followed by the run() method of t2. Each execution prints false because the two threads are not equal—one has a different priority than the other. As a result, the output is falsefalse.

43. What is the numerical range of a char data type in Java?
a) 0 to 256
b) -128 to 127
c) 0 to 65535
d) 0 to 32767
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: In Java, the char data type is a 16-bit unsigned integer that uses 2 bytes of memory. It is used to store Unicode characters, such as special symbols, emojis, and more. The range of values it can represent is from 0 to 216 − 1, which is 0 to 65,535. Being an unsigned data type, char can represent only non-negative values, effectively doubling the upper limit compared to a signed type by excluding negative numbers from its range.
For signed integer types, the range is calculated using the formula:
−2n-1 to 2n-1 − 1,
where n is the number of bits used to store the value.

        void add(double c , double d)
        {
            y = c + d;
        }
        overload() 
        {
            this.x = 0;
            this.y = 0;

            int a = 2;
            double b = 3.2;
            obj.add(a, a);
            obj.add(b, b);
            System.out.println(obj.x + " " + obj.y);     
        }
   }
a) 4 6.4
b) 6.4 6
c) 6.4 6.4
d) 6 6
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: For the method call obj.add(a, a), since a is of type int, the method defined at line 5 is executed. Similarly, for the call obj.add(b, b), since b is of type double, the method defined at line 9 is invoked. As a result, the values of x and y are set to 4 and 6.4, respectively.
Note: This behavior demonstrates polymorphism in Java, where method overloading allows different methods to be invoked based on parameter types.
output:
$ javac Overload_methods.java
$ java Overload_methods 
4 6.4

30. What is the order of namespaces in which Python looks for an identifier?
a) Python first searches the built-in namespace, then the global namespace and finally the local namespace
b) Python first searches the built-in namespace, then the local namespace and finally the global namespace
c) Python first searches the local namespace, then the global namespace and finally the built-in namespace
d) Python first searches the global namespace, then the local namespace and finally the built-in namespace
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: When Python encounters an identifier (like a variable or function name), it follows the LEGB rule to resolve it. It first looks in the Local namespace (inside the current function), then in the Enclosing namespace (if it’s a nested function), followed by the Global namespace (top-level of the module), and finally the Built-in namespace (predefined functions like len(), sum(), etc.). So, the correct search order for namespaces is: local → global → built-in.

35. What will be the output of the following Python code?

class tester:
    def __init__(self, id):
        self.id = str(id)
        id="224"
 
temp = tester(12)
print(temp.id)
a) 12
b) 224
c) None
d) Error
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: When the tester class is instantiated with temp = tester(12), the __init__ method is called. The id argument is passed as 12, and inside the __init__ method, self.id is assigned the string value of id, which is “12”. However, the local variable id is reassigned to “224”, but this change does not affect self.id, which retains the value “12”.
36. What will be the output of the following Python program?

def foo(x):
    x[0] = ['def']
    x[1] = ['abc']
    return id(x)
q = ['abc', 'def']
print(id(q) == foo(q))
a) Error
b) None
c) False
d) True
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: The list q is passed by reference to the function foo, so both x and q refer to the same object in memory. The id() function returns the memory address of the object, which remains unchanged. Therefore, id(q) == foo(q) evaluates to True.
37. Which module in the python standard library parses options received from the command line?
a) getarg
b) getopt
c) main
d) os
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: The getopt module in Python’s standard library is used to parse command-line options and arguments. It allows the script to accept flags and parameters (like -h or –help) similar to those in shell scripts. For example:
import getopt, sys
opts, args = getopt.getopt(sys.argv[1:], "h", ["help"])
This line parses short option -h and long option –help.

38. What will be the output of the following Python program?

z=set('abc')
z.add('san')
z.update(set(['p', 'q']))
print(z)
a) {‘a’, ‘c’, ‘c’, ‘p’, ‘q’, ‘s’, ‘a’, ‘n’}
b) {‘abc’, ‘p’, ‘q’, ‘san’}
c) {‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘p’, ‘q’, ‘san’}
d) {‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, [‘p’, ‘q’], ‘san}
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: The code shown first adds the element ‘san’ to the set z. The set z is then updated and two more elements, namely, ‘p’ and ‘q’ are added to it. Hence the output is: {‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘p’, ‘q’, ‘san’}

42. What will be the value of ‘result’ in following Python program?

list1 = [1,2,3,4]
list2 = [2,4,5,6]
list3 = [2,6,7,8]
result = list()
result.extend(i for i in list1 if i not in (list2+list3) and i not in result)
result.extend(i for i in list2 if i not in (list1+list3) and i not in result)
result.extend(i for i in list3 if i not in (list1+list2) and i not in result)
print(result)
a) [1, 3, 5, 7, 8]
b) [1, 7, 8]
c) [1, 2, 4, 7, 8]
d) error
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: Here, ‘result’ is a list which is extending three times. When first time ‘extend’ function is called for ‘result’, the inner code generates a generator object, which is further used in ‘extend’ function. This generator object contains the values which are in ‘list1’ only (not in ‘list2’ and ‘list3’).
Same is happening in second and third call of ‘extend’ function in these generator object contains values only in ‘list2’ and ‘list3’ respectively.
So, ‘result’ variable will contain elements which are only in one list (not more than 1 list).
43. To add a new element to a list we use which Python command?

45. What will be the output of the following Python code?

list1 = [1, 3]
list2 = list1
list1[0] = 4
print(list2)
a) [1, 4]
b) [1, 3, 4]
c) [4, 3]
d) [1, 3]
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: In the code, list2 = list1 creates a reference to the same list in memory. So when list1[0] is changed to 4, list2 also reflects that change. The output is [4, 3].

49. What will be the output of the following Python program?

i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
    if i == 3:
        break
else:
    print(0)
a) error
b)

0
1
2
3
0
c)

0
1
2
d) none of the mentioned
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: In this code, the while loop iterates from i = 0 to i = 2, printing the values of i. When i becomes 3, the if i == 3 condition is met, and the break statement is executed, which terminates the loop early. Since the loop was terminated using break, the else block is not executed. Therefore, the output is 0, 1, and 2.
50. What will be the output of the following Python code?

52. What will be the output of the following Python program?

def addItem(listParam):
    listParam += [1]
 
mylist = [1, 2, 3, 4]
addItem(mylist)
print(len(mylist))
a) 5
b) 8
c) 2
d) 1
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: The function addItem uses += [1] to modify the list passed to it. Since lists are mutable and passed by reference, mylist is modified directly. After appending 1, it becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 1], so its length is 5.
53. Which of the following is a Python tuple?

62. What will be the output of the following Python code?

def foo():
    try:
        return 1
    finally:
        return 2
k = foo()
print(k)
a) error, there is more than one return statement in a single try-finally block
b) 3
c) 2
d) 1
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: In Python, if both the try block and the finally block contain return statements, the return in the finally block overrides the one in the try block. So, even though return 1 is in the try, the function ends up returning 2 because of the finally block.
